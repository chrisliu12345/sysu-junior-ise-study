## Introduction

### What is Machine Learning

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

### Supervised Learning

- 回归：输出连续值
- 分类：输出离散值

### Unsupervised Learning

在脱离标签的情况下，从数据中直接找出数据的结构

聚类方法

### Model Representation

通过训练算法得出一个h(hypothesis)

### Cost Function

衡量模型的函数，通常用$J(\theta)$表示
